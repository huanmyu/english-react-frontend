## React lifecycle
- **componentWillMount()**: Fired once, before initial rendering occurs. Good place to wire-up message listeners. `this.setState` doesn't work here.
- **componentDidMount()**: Fired once, after initial rendering occurs. Can use `this.getDOMNode()`.
- **componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)**: Fired after the component's updates are made to the DOM. Can use `this.getDOMNode()` for updates.
- **componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)**: Invoked immediately after the component's updates are flushed to the DOM. This method is not called for the initial render. Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated.
- **componentWillUnmount()**: Fired immediately before a component is unmounted from the DOM. Good place to remove message listeners or general clean up.
- **componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)**: Fired when a component is receiving new props. You might want to `this.setState` depending on the props.
- **shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)**: Fired before rendering when new props or state are received. `return false` if you know an update isn't needed.
